[Document(page_content='This is a not-for-profit, ad-free, non-commercial Web site. The (new) Cadillac\nDatabase© is owned by the Cadillac-La Salle Club Museum & Research Center, Inc.\nNeither the CLC Museum nor Yann Saunders (aka "MrCadillac"), who compiled the\nDatabase and donated it to the Club Museum in 1999, have any financial interest in the\nCadillac Motor Car Division of General Motors Corporation (GM). They have nothing to\ngain from this site other than the simple satisfaction of sharing with other Cadillac and\nLa Salle enthusiasts throughout the world the vast array of historical and technical data\nand images contained herein that relate to the beautiful automobiles built by the\nrenowned American manufacturer.\nBorn in 1938 to give the stylist a tool for advanced research comparable to the\nlaboratory and proving ground used by the scientist and engineer, the dream car has\nbecome a world famous symbol of the American public\'s ever growing fascination with\nthe life it can expect in the future.\nThe dream car has always been far more than a gleaming automobile on a pedestal - it\nhas brought tremendous benefits to every motorist.\nIt has made possible better looking, more advanced cars produced ahead of the time\nthey might have appeared in normal evolution. Also, the dream car has given the\nmotorist a positive voice in deciding the features he wants to see on his future cars.\nGeneral Motors originated the concept of a "dream" or experimental car to test public\nreaction to design and engineering innovations.\nIn 1938, GM built the famous "Y-Job" [not showed publicly until 1940], which began a\nparade of dramatic GM experimental cars which have excited millions of people in\nAmerica and abroad. Most recent members of the group are the GM-X, the Firebird IV\nand the Runabout, introduced at the New York\'s World fair.\nThe dream car stimulates the stylist to creative thinking because it allow him to build in\nthree dimensions the futuristic ideas he conceives which are too advanced to be applied\nto the design of next year\'s model. This catches and brings to life for the motorist many\nideas which might otherwise be lost.\nOnce built and exhibited, the dream car makes it possible to gauge public reaction to its\nnew features, through customer research procedures. This evidence of acceptability\n', metadata={'source': 'source_documents/about-and-dream-cars-and-more.pdf', 'file_path': 'source_documents/about-and-dream-cars-and-more.pdf', 'page': 0, 'total_pages': 3, 'format': 'PDF 1.4', 'title': 'about-and-dream-cars-and-more', 'author': '', 'subject': '', 'keywords': '', 'creator': '', 'producer': 'Skia/PDF m117 Google Docs Renderer', 'creationDate': '', 'modDate': '', 'trapped': ''}), Document(page_content='encourages a manufacturer to spend the money to put an idea into production far\nsooner than he might if he had doubts about its acceptance.\nThe 1938 "Y-Job" had a host of "firsts" including the first electrically operated convertible\ntop, first power windows, the first extension of fenders into the front doors, and the first\nconcealed running board. After being shown across the country and tested extensively,\nit was "retired" to a GM warehouse. In 1964, it was brought out for public display once\nmore when it was selected as one of America\'s 20 styling "milepost" cars for an exhibit\nat the New York Automobile Show.\nThe Le Sabre and XP-300 were the next GM experimental cars built in 1951. LeSabre\ncame to be one of the most famous of all the dream cars. It featured the first panoramic\n"wraparound" windshield.\nIn 1953, GM began giving dream cars maximum visibility by making them the\nautomotive stars of a new traveling show called the Motorama [two earlier shows, in\n1949 and 1950, had been labeled "Transportation Unlimited" - none were held in 1951\nand 1952, while war raged in Korea]. Five cars were built and exhibited that year\nincluding the Chevrolet Corvette - an immediate hit which was later placed in production\nas America\'s first fiberglass sports car.\nThe Motorama grew bigger in 1954, and GM built for it 12 special cars including the\nFirebird I, first gas turbine auto ever built and tested in the United States. Two dream\nstation wagons, the Chevrolet Nomad and Pontiac Safari, became production cars the\nfollowing year.\nIn 1955, seven new dream cars and a dream truck, the GMC "l\'Universelle" starred in\nthe Motorama. One, the Cadillac Eldorado Brougham, has now gone into production\n[1957].\nIn 1956, five more dream cars were exhibited in the Motorama, plus the Firebird II gas\nturbine passenger car. With the Firebird II, GM styling presented a concept of a safety\nelectronic highway of tomorrow which delighted Motorama visitors.\nIn 1959 two space age cars were shown, the Cadillac Cyclone and the Firebird III, star\nof the GM Motorama.\nIt would be impossible to guess the total number of people that have viewed the three\ndozen dream cars and experimental cars created thus far by General Motors. The\nMotorama alone drew more than seven and three quarter million people in its four years\n', metadata={'source': 'source_documents/about-and-dream-cars-and-more.pdf', 'file_path': 'source_documents/about-and-dream-cars-and-more.pdf', 'page': 1, 'total_pages': 3, 'format': 'PDF 1.4', 'title': 'about-and-dream-cars-and-more', 'author': '', 'subject': '', 'keywords': '', 'creator': '', 'producer': 'Skia/PDF m117 Google Docs Renderer', 'creationDate': '', 'modDate': '', 'trapped': ''}), Document(page_content='of national tour [1953, 1954, 1955, 1956]. In addition, some of the cars are still being\nshown individually in local show and fairs both here and abroad. Others are now\nrunning on test tracks.\nThe myriad of styling and engineering features on current GM production cars has put\nyesterday\'s dream car into the hands of today\'s average motorist. And just as it has\nspearheaded progress in the past, the dream car will continue to search the future for\nautomotive improvements symbolizing the limitless imagination of the stylists and\nengineers of the auto industry."\nIn the classic thirties, Fleetwood’s peak production volume ranged from 400 to 500\nbodies every month, an incredible number when one considers the hand-finishing that\nwent into each one of them.\nMy research into the use of styling code by Fleetwood, Cadillac’s main body supplier\nsince the early Twenties, has revealed a plethora of codes used in the Golden Years\nfrom the mid-Twenties to the late Thirties. In fact there was a limited selection of basic\nstyles. However, by offering relatively simple variations to the habitable portion of these\nstandard bodies, new, individual styles were created to satisfy quickly the desires of the\nmost discerning and demanding customers - and delivery times could be kept down to\none or two months. On the other hand, individual bodies requiring a major derivation\nfrom a catalog style could delay delivery up to four months.\nOne of the first of the "extra-special customs" made by Fleetwood in 1929, before\noperations came to a halt at the old coach works in the town of Fleetwood, PA, was the\nvery first and unique Cadillac "Madame X", so named by Harley Earl after a character in\na play of the same name which he had seen at the old Fisher Theater, across the street\nfrom the GM Building in downtown Detroit. The character had been played by one\nPauline Fredericks to whom Earl had gone to pay his respects after the show (the\nactress Ruth Chatterton played the role again in ....). This unique car turned out to be a\n"prototype" for what was to become, the following year, the very stylish and rare\n"Madame X" series of four-door cars built on the new, sixteen-cylinder chassis. The first\nones were built in Pennsylvania but production was soon transferred to the new\nFleetwood shops in Detroit, starting in the second quarter 1930 [to find out more about\nthe "Madame X" models, click here].\n', metadata={'source': 'source_documents/about-and-dream-cars-and-more.pdf', 'file_path': 'source_documents/about-and-dream-cars-and-more.pdf', 'page': 2, 'total_pages': 3, 'format': 'PDF 1.4', 'title': 'about-and-dream-cars-and-more', 'author': '', 'subject': '', 'keywords': '', 'creator': '', 'producer': 'Skia/PDF m117 Google Docs Renderer', 'creationDate': '', 'modDate': '', 'trapped': ''})]Loading new documents: 100%|█████████████████████| 4/4 [00:00<00:00, 101.94it/s]

Well, if you look at the ad for the 2007 Cadillac DTS [an unfortunate acronym for someone like me whose late alcoholic father suffered from the DTs!], what seems to be most important is having a "nicely erquipped" car (whatever that means), with new-fangled gizmos like a "touch-screen, DVD-based, navigation [system] with voice recognition" and an "8-speaker, Bose sound system with CD/MP3 player." \n', metadata={'source': 'questions_with_answers.json', 'num': 7}), Document(page_content="question: How do I repair my car?; answer: I'm sorry to hear that you're experiencing a technical issue with your Cadillac.

And just as it has\nspearheaded progress in the past, the dream car will continue to search the future for\nautomotive improvements symbolizing the limitless imagination of the stylists and\nengineers of the auto industry."\nIn the classic thirties, Fleetwood’s peak production volume ranged from 400 to 500\nbodies every month, an incredible number when one considers the hand-finishing that\nwent into each one of them.\nMy research into the use of styling code by Fleetwood, Cadillac’s main body supplier\nsince the early Twenties, has revealed a plethora of codes used in the Golden Years\nfrom the mid-Twenties to the late Thirties. In fact there was a limited selection of basic\nstyles. However, by offering relatively simple variations to the habitable portion of these\nstandard bodies, new, individual styles were created to satisfy quickly the desires of the\nmost discerning and demanding customers - and delivery times could be kept down to\none or two months. On the other hand, individual bodies requiring a major derivation\nfrom a catalog style could delay delivery up to four months.\nOne of the first of the "extra-special customs" made by Fleetwood in 1929, before\noperations came to a halt at the old coach works in the town of Fleetwood, PA, was the\nvery first and unique Cadillac "Madame X", so named by Harley Earl after a character in\na play of the same name which he had seen at the old Fisher Theater, across the street\nfrom the GM Building in downtown Detroit. The character had been played by one\nPauline Fredericks to whom Earl had gone to pay his respects after the show (the\nactress Ruth Chatterton played the role again in ....). This unique car turned out to be a\n"prototype" for what was to become, the following year, the very stylish and rare\n"Madame X" series of four-door cars built on the new, sixteen-cylinder chassis. The first\nones were built in Pennsylvania but production was soon transferred to the new\nFleetwood shops in Detroit, starting in the second quarter 1930 [to find out more about\nthe "Madame X" models, click here].\n', metadata={'source': 'source_documents/about-and-dream-cars-and-more.pdf', 'file_path': 'source_documents/about-and-dream-cars-and-more.pdf', 'page': 2, 'total_pages': 3, 'format': 'PDF 1.4', 'title': 'about-and-dream-cars-and-more', 'author': '', 'subject': '', 'keywords': '', 'creator': '', 'producer': 'Skia/PDF m117 Google Docs Renderer', 'creationDate': '', 'modDate': '', 'trapped': ''})]

And just as it has\nspearheaded progress in the past, the dream car will continue to search the future for\nautomotive improvements symbolizing the limitless imagination of the stylists and\nengineers of the auto industry."\nIn the classic thirties, Fleetwood’s peak production volume ranged from 400 to 500\nbodies every month, an incredible number when one considers the hand-finishing that\nwent into each one of them.\nMy research into the use of styling code by Fleetwood, Cadillac’s main body supplier\nsince the early Twenties, has revealed a plethora of codes used in the Golden Years\nfrom the mid-Twenties to the late Thirties. In fact there was a limited selection of basic\nstyles. However, by offering relatively simple variations to the habitable portion of these\nstandard bodies, new, individual styles were created to satisfy quickly the desires of the\nmost discerning and demanding customers - and delivery times could be kept down to\none or two months. On the other hand, individual bodies requiring a major derivation\nfrom a catalog style could delay delivery up to four months.\nOne of the first of the "extra-special customs" made by Fleetwood in 1929, before\noperations came to a halt at the old coach works in the town of Fleetwood, PA, was the\nvery first and unique Cadillac "Madame X", so named by Harley Earl after a character in\na play of the same name which he had seen at the old Fisher Theater, across the street\nfrom the GM Building in downtown Detroit. The character had been played by one\nPauline Fredericks to whom Earl had gone to pay his respects after the show (the\nactress Ruth Chatterton played the role again in ....). This unique car turned out to be a\n"prototype" for what was to become, the following year, the very stylish and rare\n"Madame X" series of four-door cars built on the new, sixteen-cylinder chassis. The first\nones were built in Pennsylvania but production was soon transferred to the new\nFleetwood shops in Detroit, starting in the second quarter 1930 [to find out more about\nthe "Madame X" models, click here].\n', metadata={'source': 'source_documents/source_documents/about-and-dream-cars-and-more.pdf', 'file_path': 'source_documents/source_documents/about-and-dream-cars-and-more.pdf', 'page': 2, 'total_pages': 3, 'format': 'PDF 1.4', 'title': 'about-and-dream-cars-and-more', 'author': '', 'subject': '', 'keywords': '', 'creator': '', 'producer': 'Skia/PDF m117 Google Docs Renderer', 'creationDate': '', 'modDate': '', 'trapped': ''})]Loading new documents: 100%|█████████████████████| 8/8 [00:00<00:00, 138.23it/s]
